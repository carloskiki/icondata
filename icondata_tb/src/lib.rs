//! This crate provides a collection of icons in the form of SVG data
//! and an enum to select them.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Every icon is shipped as its own feature; the enum variant and their corresponding feature name are
//! identical.
//!

/// This enum provides every icon as a variant.
/// It implements [`Into<icondata_core::IconData>`][icondata_core::IconData].
